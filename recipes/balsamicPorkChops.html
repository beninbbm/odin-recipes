    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jazz up your weeknight pan-fried pork chops with a balsamic glaze! We like these with steamed broccoli and a crispy, fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Bone-in Pork Chops, 3/4-inch Thick</li>
        <li>Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Butter</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Cup Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>Â¼ Cup Good Quality Balsamic Vinegar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat pork chops dry with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>When butter and oil shimmer, carefully add chops and cook over medium heat until browned on one side, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn and cook pork chops until no longer pink in the center and browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook the chops or they will turn dry and hard. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove pork chops from heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Combine chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, and honey in a small saucepan. Bring glaze to a boil over medium-high heat and boil until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle pan-fried chops with balsamic glaze and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
